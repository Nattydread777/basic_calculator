# Basic Calculator 

A beginner-friendly Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — based on user input.

##  How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open a terminal in the folder containing `basic_calculator.py`.
4. Run the program with:

##  Features
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)

##  Example Output
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): +
10 + 5 = 15.0


##  Notes
- Division by zero will return an error message instead of crashing the program.
- The program is case-sensitive for operations (`+ - * /`).
